# TxAdmin-Desktop-App

## What is this?
This is just an electron JS app that replicates your txadmin to a desktop app. It's nothing special just something cool I made.

## Requirements 
To use this app you will need to add your own domain by going to /src/index.js on line two change the URL to yours. To change the app icon replace the logo.png in the src directory with your own.



## Building The App
To use this app you need to build the app follow these steps:

### Step One:
```bash
npm i
```

### Step Two:
```bash
npm run make
```

### Step Three:
```bash
npm run publish
```

### Step Four:
Navigate to the /out/make folder and there will be a .zip folder in there. It may be buried in a few folders.

### Step Five: 
Thats it! Your done!
